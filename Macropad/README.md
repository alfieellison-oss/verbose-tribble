\# Alfie's CAD Macropad

Hello! This is my submission for hackpad! This was made with the intention to streamline common cad commands in Autodesk software.



\## Features

\- 5 keyboard switches

\- A rotary encoder with button function

\- kmk firmware

\## PCB

Here are pictures of my pcb:

\## CAD

Designed using FreeCAD! It was painful. Be glad you have the current guide, I spent 10+ hours figuring out how to do everything correctly (and even like this I still did stupid stuff).

Everything fits together with 4 m3 screws and bolts



\## Firmware



I wrote the firmware using kmk, you can see it inside the repo. It can be used to control your mouse!



\## Notes

Making the pad was fun ^.^ but I was just too paranoid that something would go wrong and made 15+ revisions lol. Ended up learning how to use OpenSCAD and FreeCAD.
